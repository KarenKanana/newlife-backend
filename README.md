# NewLife Hospital App

## Introduction
Newlife Hospital App is an application that looks to simplify healthcare processes for both practitioners eg doctors, nurses, surgeons, nutritionists, caregivers etc and the patients themselves

## Problem Statement
As a result of lack of proper management systems in the healthcare institutions, many patients succumb to their illnesses due to irregular checkups and appointments. Practitioners have a lot of patients to cater for making it easy to lose track of duties they are to attend to in a timely manner.
Lack of proper planning can lead to dire consequences to both the medical institution and the practitioners themselves
